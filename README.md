# Responsive menu landing page

## Description:

Responsive, multi-section landing page with dynamically added content and navigation menu that changes appearance based on the viewport and what the user is looking at.

### In greater detail:

This final form of this has been completely changed since I've started working on it to use it on my portfolio site. What see now, is the actual landing page of that. The same code with some additional changes (for example links that are working), can be found in the "Portfolio Site" repository.

### This project among others is using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Observer
- Normalization 

### Instructions 

Just open the HTML in your Browser.

#### It was made by [Dio Papadopoulos](https://dio-papa-portfolio-site.herokuapp.com/travellingWeatherApp) as part of Udacity's front end developer course.
